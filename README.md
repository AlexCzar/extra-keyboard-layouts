<b id="note1">1</b> For some of the layouts, combo key ligatures that on other OSs can be typed by shift+numbers are not directly supported. Instead, you'll have to type the components individually. 

For Hindi for example on a QWERTY keyboard, instead of shift + 3 you have to type D+J
* D J ्र 
* J D र् 
* P D SHIFT+] ज्ञ 
* L D J त्र 
* K D SHIFT+, क्ष

For Jawi SIRIM, the B key does not type anything. and you should be able to reproduce its behavior by typing G followed by H and G followed by SHIFT + N
* G H لا
* G SHIFT + N لآ
* G SHIFT + H لأ
* G SHIFT + Y لإ
